Advantages of Abstraction:-
==========================
Abstraction is a key concept in Java that allows you to create abstract classes and interfaces to define common behaviors and characteristics without providing implementation details. Here are some advantages of abstraction in Java:

-> Modularity and Code Organization: Abstraction helps in breaking down complex systems into manageable and modular components. By defining abstract classes and interfaces, you can group related methods and properties together, promoting code organization and making it easier to understand and maintain.

-> Hiding Implementation Details: Abstraction allows you to hide the internal implementation details of a class or module. By providing only the necessary interface or contract, you can conceal the complexity and internal workings, reducing dependencies and protecting sensitive information. This promotes security and enhances code maintainability.

-> Reusability: Abstraction promotes code reusability by providing a blueprint or template that can be used to create multiple concrete implementations. Abstract classes and interfaces serve as a basis for creating new classes that adhere to the defined behavior. This saves development time and effort, as existing abstractions can be leveraged to build new functionality.

-> Polymorphism and Flexibility: Abstraction facilitates polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably through a common interface. By programming to the abstract type, you can write code that is more flexible and adaptable to different implementations. This enhances code extensibility and promotes the "Open-Closed Principle" of software design.

-> Loose Coupling: Abstraction helps in achieving loose coupling between different components or modules of a system. By depending on abstract types (interfaces or abstract classes) rather than concrete implementations, you reduce direct dependencies and create a clear separation of concerns. This promotes flexibility, modularity, and easier maintenance of the codebase.

-> Testability and Debugging: Abstraction enhances testability and debugging by isolating components. By relying on abstract interfaces, you can create mock or stub implementations for testing purposes, allowing you to test components in isolation. Additionally, when debugging, you can focus on the abstraction and its contract rather than the intricate details of the concrete implementation.
