Final Class:-
============
 A final class is a class that cannot be extended or subclassed. It serves as the final implementation of a class, and no other class can inherit from it. This prevents any further modifications to the class's behavior or structure. Marking a class as final is often done to ensure that the class's design, functionality, or security cannot be altered or compromised by other classes.
Example:

final class MyFinalClass {
    // Class implementation
}

In the above example, the class MyFinalClass is declared as final. It cannot be extended or subclassed.

Benefits of Final Classes:-

-> Security: By making a class final, you ensure that its implementation cannot be overridden or compromised by creating a subclass with altered behavior.

-> Performance: Final classes allow the compiler to perform certain optimizations, as it knows that the class cannot be extended or overridden.

-> Design and Stability: Final classes provide a clear and stable implementation, which can be important when designing critical classes or APIs.
