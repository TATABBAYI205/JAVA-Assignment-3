Inheritance :-
=============
class ParentClass {
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("This is the display method of the parent class.");
    }
}
class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("This is the display method of the child class.");
    }
}
public class InheritanceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ParentClass parent = new ParentClass();
        parent.display();

        ChildClass child = new ChildClass();
        child.display();

        ParentClass polymorphicChild = new ChildClass();
        polymorphicChild.display();
    }
}

When a method in a ChildClass has the same name and type signature as a method in its ParentClass,then the method in the sub class is said to override the method in the ChildClass.Like overloading,it is a feature that supports polymorphism.

When an overridden method is called from within a subclass,it will always refer to the version of the method defined by the childclass.The parentclass version of the method is hidden.

In the above code,we see that child class overrides the method dislpay() in parentclass.
